# Flappy Bird Game

A simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame.

## Description

Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. This implementation recreates the core gameplay mechanics of the original game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Features

- **Bird flapping**: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
- **Score tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases whenever the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.
- **Randomized obstacles**: The pipes are randomly generated, providing a different challenge each time the game is played.
- **Collision detection**: The game checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or the ground, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Welcome screen**: A welcome screen is displayed at the start of the game, allowing the player to start the game by pressing a key.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command:
```shell
     pip install pygame
```
3. Run the game using the following command:
```shell
     python main.py
```

## Controls

- **Spacebar**: Flap the bird to avoid obstacles and navigate through the pipes.
- **Escape key** or close the game window: Quit the game.
